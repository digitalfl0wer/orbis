          I built Orbis as a solution to my constant struggle with coding challenges while prepping for interviews. I didn’t want another dashboard of guilt, I wanted a tiny
          space that felt supportive, focused, and honest about how practice actually feels on different days. Orbis is my
          sandbox for mixing modern web tech, AI, and soft-on-the-nervous-system design.
